Screenstory
===========

About
-----

A simple application to periodically create screenshots and save them away with a timestamp. I created this to be able to
go back in time and see what I was working on at a given moment. So it's your history in screenshots, hence the name.

Dependencies
------------

* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)

OS Compatibility
----------------

I've only tested this on Ubuntu, but since PyQt is cross-platform, there's no reason I can think of why it shouldn't work on Windows or MacOS.

Usage
-----

Run screenstory.py, set the interval and press 'start!'. Screenshots will be saved to a ./snapshots in PNG format.
